| LLM      | Usability    | Notes                         |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| claude   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  | No explanation required       |
| openai   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Perfectly supports multi-step function calls (gpt-4o-mini also works) |
| gemini flash 2.0   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåô | Very usable                  |

## Usage

* 1. Configure APIKEY, ensure your LLM service is compatible with OpenAI style.
* 2. Ensure you have `uv + nodejs` installed on your system.

### [uvx & uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

Install via command line or check the official GitHub tutorial [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```
# MacOS
brew install uv
# Windows
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```
### [npx & nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Install via command line or download it from the official site, [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
```
# MacOS
brew install node
# Windows
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

## Development

```
cd electron && npm install
cd web && pnpm install
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Note
