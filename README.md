| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| claude   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   | No explanation                |
| openai   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  | Also supports multi-step function call perfectly (gpt-4o-mini also works) |
| gemini flash 2.0   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåô | Very usable                  |
| qwen       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåô    | Very usable                  |
| doubao       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê    | Feels okay to use             |
| deepseek | ‚≠ê‚≠ê      | Multi-step function call may have issues |

## Usage

* 1. Configure APIKEY, ensuring your LLM service is compatible with the OpenAI style.
* 2. Ensure that `uv + nodejs` is installed on your system.

### [uvx & uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```
# MacOS
brew install uv
# Windows
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```

### [npx & nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

```
# MacOS
brew install node
# Windows
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```
