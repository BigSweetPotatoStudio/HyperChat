## Usage

* 1. Configure APIKEY, ensure your LLM service is compatible with OpenAI style.
* 2. Ensure that `uv + nodejs` are installed on your system.

### [uvx & uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

Install using the command line, or check the official GitHub tutorial [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```
# MacOS
brew install uv
# Windows
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```

### [npx & nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Install using the command line, or download and install from the official website, [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

```
# MacOS
brew install node
# Windows
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

## Development

```
cd electron && npm install
cd web && npm install
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

* If you encounter a damaged or permission issue on MacOS, run `sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/HyperChat.app`
* MacOS `nvm` users should manually set PATH with `echo $PATH`, Windows version of `nvm` seems to work directly
