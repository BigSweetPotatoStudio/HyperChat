## Usage

* 1. Configure APIKEY, make sure your LLM service is compatible with OpenAI style.
* 2. Ensure your system has `uv + nodejs` installed.

Install using the command line, or check the official GitHub tutorial [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```
# MacOS
brew install uv
# windows
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
```
### [npx & nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Install using the command line, or download from the official site, official [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
```
# MacOS
brew install node
# windows
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```
