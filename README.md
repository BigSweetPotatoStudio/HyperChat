```
# MacOS
brew install uv
# windows
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```
### [npx & nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Install using the command line or download from the official website, [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
```
# MacOS
brew install node
# windows
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```
