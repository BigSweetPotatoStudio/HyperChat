## Functionality

HyperChat is an open-minded Chat client that can use APIs from various LLMs, fully supports MCP, and delivers the best Chat experience. It also implements a productivity MAX tool based on a native Agent.

* Supports OpenAI-style LLMs: `OpenAI`, `Claude(OpenRouter)`, `Qwen`, `Deepseek`, `GLM`, `Ollama`.
* Built-in MCP plugin market with user-friendly MCP installation configuration, one-click installation, and submissions are welcome at [HyperChatMCP](https://github.com/BigSweetPotatoStudio/HyperChatMCP).
* Also supports manual installation of third-party MCPs by filling in `command`, `args`, `env`.

### LLM

| LLM      | Usability    | Notes                         |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| claude   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  | No explanation needed                   |
| openai   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Also perfectly supports multi-step function calls (gpt-4o-mini can also) |
| gemini flash 2.0   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåô | Very useful |
| qwen       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåô    | Very useful                 |
| doubao       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåôüåô    | Feels okay to use                   |
| deepseek | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåôüåô      | Multi-step function calls may have issues       |
