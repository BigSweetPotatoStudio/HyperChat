## Usage

* 1. Configure the APIKEY, ensure your LLM service is compatible with OpenAI style.
* 2. Ensure you have `uv + nodejs` installed in your system.

### [uvx & uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

Install via command line, or check the official GitHub tutorial [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```
# MacOS
brew install uv
# Windows
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```
### [npx & nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Install via command line, or download from the official website [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
```
# MacOS
brew install node
# Windows
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

## Development

```
cd electron && npm install
cd web && pnpm install
